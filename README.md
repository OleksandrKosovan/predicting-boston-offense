# Boston offenses. Researching and predicting

# I. Business Proposal

**How safe is Boston compared with other big cities around the United States?**

It ranked roughly in the middle. Boston was more violent than New York and Seattle, but less violent than Chicago and Las Vegas, according to numbers from the FBI, based on crimes committed in 2015. Nationally, Boston ranked 47 out of 79 cities with populations of 250,000 or more. [*Sourse*](https://www.northeastern.edu/thescope/2017/06/21/boston-crime-map-how-safe-is-your-neighborhood/)

**Can we prediction offenses (*time, location, probability*)?**

It is main question and task for me. I want to prediction time, location and probability for offenses. 

You can imagine it: we have prediction map with probability for each offenses groups.

**What are possible roles?**

It will be useful for:
- Each human
- Government
- Police
- Business

And it can help reduce number of offenses.
