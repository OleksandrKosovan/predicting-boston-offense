# Machine Learning

I tried different combination for fitting models.

1.0. Fitting with all data: [Link](https://github.com/OleksandrKosovan/predicting-boston-offense/blob/master/9-machine-learning/1-0-total-data.ipynb) :link:

1.1. Fitting and elimination some features: [Link](https://github.com/OleksandrKosovan/predicting-boston-offense/blob/master/9-machine-learning/1-1-total-data.ipynb) :link:

2.1. Select 2013-2015 years: [Link](https://github.com/OleksandrKosovan/predicting-boston-offense/blob/master/9-machine-learning/2-select-years-16-17-18.ipynb) :link:

2.2. Select 2016-2018 years: [Link](https://github.com/OleksandrKosovan/predicting-boston-offense/blob/master/9-machine-learning/2-select-years-16-17-18.ipynb) :link:

3. Fitting for three the best groups [Link](https://github.com/OleksandrKosovan/predicting-boston-offense/blob/master/9-machine-learning/3-three-groups.ipynb) :link:

4. Three groups and selecr years: [Link](https://github.com/OleksandrKosovan/predicting-boston-offense/blob/master/9-machine-learning/4-three-groups-and-select%20year.ipynb) :link:
