# Adding new data

I found Boston data for diffenrent object. I selected for merging this data:

- Colleges and Universities location
- Non Public Schools location
- Location clusters
- Public Schools location

I didn't use ther data from this directory.


**How i merged data?**

I created three features for each data. It is:

- ...number_near - (*Number of some object, which is nearer than 3 km for offenses location*)
- ...distance_min - (*Minimum distance some object near offenses location*)
- ...distance_25 - (*Percentile for all distances*)
